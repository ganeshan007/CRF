1_0,P,I think I want to eat healthy.,id,,,0
1_1,P,I want to completely cut out fast food. I want to have more set meals and I just want to eat healthy food. Okay.,id,,,0
1_2,P,I think I at least needs to go to the grocery. Okay.,id,,,0
1_3,T,Is that something that you haven't been doing?,irq,,,1
1_4,P,"No, not lately. I've just been grabbing food at work, or going through fast food on the way home. Okay.",id,,,0
1_5,P,"Like, I just haven't had the energy or desire to go and I've also been been working a lot trying to save up money for the baby. Finding the time might be hard. Okay,",id,,,0
1_6,P,"I used to go every week on Sunday. And I used to already have a list in mind before I went,",id,,,0
1_7,P,That would probably make it more likely for me to go. I don't have to be at work until the afternoon that day. So I can maybe go asleep and a little bit maybe at like 10 o'clock on Sunday.,id,,,0
1_8,P,"Well, lately when I haven't felt like doing things that I really need to do, I'll give myself a reward. And I know that there's this great bakery on the way. So if I tell myself, if I go to the grocery, then I can stop by the bakery on the way home, then I may be more likely to go.",id,,,0
10_0,T,"Hello stone, ",gt,,,2
10_1,P,yes.,gt,,,2
10_2,T,"Hi, I'm PJ Daniels. Sorry, let me wash my hands.",gc,,,3
10_3,P,"Call me, Dorothy.",gc,,,3
10_4,T,"Oh, thank you. That's the next thing I was going to ask you. So Dorothy, the nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care is but what's going on?",irq,,,1
10_5,P,"Five days ago, I was admitted to emergency. And they treated me by putting this tube down my throat. And I tried to, to tell them and gesture at them that I don't want this tube down my throat. And I just hope that never happens again.",id,,,0
10_6,T,"Okay. No, I totally understand that. I mean, that is quite a scary thing to go through. And I think we do need to talk about this more, and I'm glad that you've asked it. Talk to me about this. So I had a little bit of a look through your charts. I think I understand why they did it. But did anybody explain it to you?",irq,,,1
10_7,P,"Well, not really. And because I was gasping for air and in the state I was, but I'll tell you what, I'm really worried that this won't happen to me again. I don't want that to be anymore. I'm, I'm okay to to pass this. ",id,,,0
10_8,T,"Absolutely. And you know what? There's no right answer when it comes to deciding on things that are aggressive, like the two, we really want to know what the patient values in terms of, you know, things that are that invasive, and so absolutely will respect whatever it is that you want. But I do need to find out a little bit more about you in terms of what is your understanding of what brought you into hospital.",irq,,,1
10_9,P,"Well, I have congested Part failure. And I guess there was water in my lungs and stopping me from breathing properly. So I was living in my soul, the ambulance brought me in to the emergency. So they that was how they were treating me.",id,,,0
10_10,T,So you pretty much showed up to emergency. And very quickly they put that tube down.,irq,,,1
10_11,P,That's correct.,id,,,0
10_12,T,Did anybody ask you if you were okay with that?,irq,,,1
10_13,P,"Well, I tried to gesture to them that I don't want the tube but",id,,,0
10_14,T,they didn't quite pick up on that.,irq,,,1
10_15,P,"I guess not. And, you know, I've had that three times already. I don't want to go through with",id,,,0
10_16,T,the two you've had.,irq,,,1
10_17,P,Yes. I don't want it anymore.,id,,,0
10_18,T,"Okay. And so so you have congestive heart failure, and it sounds like you've got a breathing problem. Yes. And do you know why they would have put the tube down. Do you know what they were trying to do?",irq,,,1
10_19,P,"I guess because I was short of air. I had a hard time breathing, right? So they tried to, like, I'm going to use the word save me.",id,,,0
10_20,T,"Right. So it sounds like you understand that. I mean, usually we only put a tube in. If that was the only thing we could do to save you. Most of the time of congestive heart failure. We'll give some medications. Have you heard of lasix? Or furosemide? No, okay. It's a medication will often give if someone is in heart failure, but if someone is really sick, and then we don't think we have time to give it that's the time we would think of a breathing tube. haven't had a chance to look through the chart, but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in.",irq,,,1
10_21,P,"I I guess so. But I'm okay with dying. Okay. You know, like I says, I've lived a good life and if it If the good Lord says that it's my time, I'm okay with that. And you wouldn't put it to",id,,,0
10_22,T,"No, my know already what I'm hearing from you. Exactly. I'm just gonna say exactly what you've said, sounds like you've lived a good life. You've been through this a few times, you know exactly what it involves. And if I could paraphrase to you quality of life is more important than quantity at this stage. Is that correct?",irq,,,1
10_23,P,"That is correct. And, but you know, what, doctor? How can I be assured that my wishes are respected, so I don't get this tube down?",id,,,0
10_24,T,"That's an excellent question. So first, I did want to answer your previous question, based on what we're talking about. Absolutely. I agree with you that it is your wish, and we will respect that wish that we're not going to put a breathing tube down again. And then of course, your second question, which is great, as well as how do we make sure this doesn't happen? So what I'm going to do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions, To ask you but after conversation, I write a note documenting what we talked about that we talked about the breathing too. And your reasons for why you don't want it, which of course makes sense to me. And then what I do is I document a short form called goals of care. And I just so it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds, I know exactly what you want, we will give you a copy of that to take home. But I find that's not usually enough. What we also do, what I do is I tend to when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor. And that notes actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta. And in that note will very clearly state you and I have this conversation and you really didn't want the breathing to so I reassure you, we'll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don't want that to Okay.",irq,,,1
10_25,P,"All Thank you. I'm I was so concerned about that and yes, I I think I will rest now because like I say, that was a horrendous experience. And he says it won't happen again.",id,,,0
10_26,T,"Okay. I do want to ask you just a few other questions related to this. Go ahead. And the first question might sound a little off putting, but I sort of have to ask it anytime someone is changing the kind of therapy they want. We do have to ask, how was your mood? How are you feeling?",irq,,,1
10_27,P,I'm I'm feeling fine. My mood is fine. I have no no problems.,id,,,0
10_28,T," Okay, excellent. And how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital? Like when you're healthy as healthy as you can be? Say a few weeks ago?",irq,,,1
10_29,P,"I think I am enjoying life. Okay. Yes, I am enjoying life to the to the best I can. ",id,,,0
10_30,T,"Okay, great. Yeah. And then other related questions, we did talk about the two that we wouldn't put it in. But again, we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want. Okay? So if we had to give you medications to get your breathing better, is that something you'd be willing to have?",irq,,,1
10_31,P,"Certainly, Oh, yes. Oh, look at medication, just not the intubation.",irq,,,1
10_32,T,"Okay. And then usually along the lines with the intubation when people don't want the intubation, we often also want to know, if a nurse were to walk into the room and find just by bad luck, you would pass away or if someone just found you at home, who had passed away. Would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shocks trying to bring you back to life?",irq,,,1
10_33,P,"No, no, no, I like I said, the good Lord knows when it's my time.",id,,,0
10_34,T,"No, and that'll make sense to me with no breathing.",irq,,,1
10_35,P,"Yes, and I have no problems with that.",id,,,0
10_36,T,"There are some other things we can do. That's not a breathing tube, but they're a little aggressive. And one is have you ever heard of bipap?",ynq,,,4
10_37,P,I don't think so.,yna,,,5
10_38,T,"It's a mass that really pushes air into you. It's a little uncomfortable, but nothing as bad as a breathing tube. Maybe hard to answer this question, because you don't know what that is. But to have any thoughts on that, if you were really sick if we were to try just a mask, and we would do it just as long as you were okay with it and comfortable at the time,",id,,,0
10_39,P,would it be for a long time?,irq,,,1
10_40,T,"Now, usually, most times with bipap? It's only about two to six hours for most patients.",id,,,0
10_41,P,"Yeah, that would be okay with me. Okay. And if",ack,,,6
10_42,T,"we had to put large IVs and lines into your wrist and stuff, and take you to the intensive care unit. Again, we wouldn't do breathing too, but this is just to watch you closely.",gc,,,3
10_43,P,"Yeah, I would be okay with that. Yes, yes. It doesn't sound invasive to me.",gc,,,3
10_44,T,Okay.,ack,,,6
10_45,P,"No, I just needed to be reassured that that it won't happen again. And and yeah, I'm, I know that on my chart. It's there. Yes, yes. And that's all I need to hear because I was concerned. Okay. ",id,,,0
10_46,T,"I do want to say that this is not set in stone, in the sense that if you ever change your mind, we can have the conversation again. But if we don't hear from you, this is what will go with no breathing to no registered in the heart. I just want you to know that in case anything were to change,",cmd,,,7
10_47,P,"okay. So if I change my mind, I can I will talk to you. ",yna,,,5
10_48,T,Absolutely.,ack,,,6
10_49,P,I don't think I'll change.,gc,,,3
10_50,T,"I don't think you will either. But it's just nice to see that you're aware of that. Okay. Um, honestly, I mean, there's some other questions. I tend to ask people when I don't know them. Well, just kind of routine stuff. Okay. And maybe we'll just quickly go through it go your medical history is the heart failure Anything else?",irq,,,1
10_51,P,"Um, that's it. I'm beginning with an ass but I can't remember what it is.",id,,,0
10_52,T,"Okay, that's okay. We can usually we have it written down. Yeah, your medications. I think I saw you're on aspirin and two jocks and I think two others. Do you happen to know or have them written down?",irq,,,1
10_53,P,You don't want I always carry this paper with me because I can't remember the name. So okay.,id,,,0
10_54,T,"Oh, so you are on the water pill? The furosemide. Okay, ",ynq,,,4
10_55,P,yes.,ack,,,6
10_56,T,"And. Okay, great. Yeah. Um, any allergies? ",ynq,,,4
10_57,P,No.,yna,,,5
10_58,T,"Okay. And I won't ask but anything that runs in your family, given your age, they told me you're 70 Is that correct? ",ynq,,,4
10_59,P,That is correct.,ack,,,6
10_60,T,Yes. And I do have to ask the following Questions completely unrelated to what we're talking about. That's okay. Do you smoke at all?,irq,,,1
10_61,P,"No, I don't ",id,,,0
10_62,T,drink any alcohol.,irq,,,1
10_63,P,"No, no. ",id,,,0
10_64,T,"Okay. And this will be sound crazy, but I have to ask any street drugs, illegal drugs, anything like that?",irq,,,1
10_65,P,"No, I never had the opportunity",id,,,0
10_66,T,to test any over the counter herbals In addition to these.,irq,,,1
10_67,P,"No, I don't take any of those. ",id,,,0
10_68,T,And where are you living right now.,irq,,,1
10_69,P,"I'm living in a convalescent home for the last six months. I used to live in my own home. And six months ago, I'm moved to a convalescent home.",id,,,0
10_70,T,Okay. And how do you feel about that? That changed six months ago.,irq,,,1
10_71,P,"I would really prefer my own home. But just trouble with my breathing sometimes, right?",id,,,0
10_72,T,So you feeling better about being in that place now? A new home,irq,,,1
10_73,P,"It's okay. Okay, I really have to adjust. Like I say, if I had my druthers, I'd go back but I guess I have to learn to adjust to this right. Okay.",id,,,0
10_74,T,So I think I sort of have all the information I need to make sure that your wishes are respected. Just one last time. Anything else you want to talk about today?,ynq,,,4
10_75,P,"Oh, you answered my question. I was so worried about this tube. ",yna,,,5
10_76,T,"Okay. All right. Well, it's very nice to meet you and Stone.",gt,,,2
10_77,P,Thank you.,gt,,,2
100_0,T,"Okay, a great job on your homework was really excellent. He listened to the imaginal exposure recording about six times. And you did the exposure, the in vivo exposure of walking around and touching things like doorknobs and other surfaces and objects you normally wouldn't touch both at your house and other places you went, and you sat down on the floor, and you even ate lunch off the floor at your house and at your mom's house. Okay, and no washing, no wash, no, no hand washing, no extra washing. Perfect. Good for you. Okay, so what did you learn from all that? Do you think over the course of the time you've done that?",id,,,0
100_1,P,It just got easier. At the beginning. It was really hard. And I feel like my stats were much higher than the end. So I guess that was what we talked about the,id,,,0
100_2,T,"habituation, habituation, right? Yeah. The fact that when you do something like that, that initially makes you anxious, and you do it repeatedly, especially in for prolonged periods of time. Your anxiety comes down, right? We're just not built to stay in definitely anxious. Okay. You notice any other changes or anything else?",ynq,,,4
100_3,P,"I noticed that before doing the exposures, I was really, really anxious. And then it kind of went down, like the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed.",id,,,0
100_4,T,Right. Did that change by so yesterday?,ynq,,,4
100_5,P,Yeah.,yna,,,5
100_6,T,"So you're saying you're not only notice that it went down during the exposure, but you started feeling less anxious even approaching instead? Good? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. All right. Good. Okay. All right. So you're doing so well. We're going to take another step up the hierarchy today like we planned, right. Okay. So this is the dog leash day. You bring it? Yeah. Okay, good. All right. We'll get to that later in the session. First, we're going to do some imaginal exposure. Okay? And you remember what the purpose of that is? Why Why are we going to do imaginal exposure?",irq,,,1
100_7,P,That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence of getting sick in my case,id,,,0
100_8,T,"right. So the idea is, this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation in imagination with the consequences you fear of touching things that are contaminated and not washing, doing your rituals. Right. Okay, perfect. So did you write the story? ",irq,,,1
100_9,P,I would say like a 70.,id,,,0
100_10,T,Okay. All right. Go ahead and start when you're ready. Should we press play? Thank you for reminding me to start the recording. So you have that for homework. Okay.,id,,,0
100_11,P,"So I'm in my house and the dog starts barking, and I know that that means that I have to take him out. I really don't want to so I'm thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can do it. But I know the dog keeps barking, he's gonna wake up the baby. So I decided to go to the front door and get a leash. I'm not going to wear the gloves they usually wear so I feel we experienced touching the leash. But I'm already feeling really anxious. And I look at the leash and I see that it's gross and full of hair and the dog has been biting on it and in probably has saliva and other things and I see stains and Miss test thinking or if that's dog poop and I get sick and I just feel myself shaking and really sweaty. And my heart is beating really fast. So I'm feeling really, really anxious but I push myself and I grab leash, and I get the dog, open the door, go out and grab the leash.",id,,,0
100_12,T,Okay let me now your stress level,irq,,,1
100_13,P,like 90,id,,,0
100_14,T,"Okay, you're doing great, just keep going.",id,,,0
100_15,P,"So I grab the leash, and the dog is pulling and I feel the lease kind of pushing through my skin and I'm thinking all the bacteria that's getting there and I'm going to get sick, wanna vomit, but I just keep going. So I walk the dog, come back home, and I just leave the leash in the front door. And I'm thinking, I'm probably going to get sick. I really want to wash my hands. I really want to take a shower. But I try not to and I stopped myself. And I'm feeling really, really anxious. So I can't stop thinking about washing. So I tried to go to bed. Decided to fall asleep. The next morning I wake up, and I already feel sick. I know I'm sick. I'm shivering and I'm, I feel like I have a fever and I'm shaking again and I'm really nauseated. So I go to the bathroom, start vomiting. And I know I'm sick. I already got something I should have washed. I started thinking about that. Going to get the baby sick. And I feel really, really sick.",id,,,0
100_16,T,"Okay, great job. What's your level now?",irq,,,1
100_17,P,Like 80. Okay.,id,,,0
100_18,T,"All right. So just keep visualizing this. I'm going to describe it now. And you just stay with that image as much as you can. So you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done and do things for dinner. Suddenly, you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know, that means He needs to go out. And Joe is not going to be home for hours. And you really don't want to take him out. But you have to. And it makes you sick and tired and upset, because you're not going to use the gloves that you always use when you have to take them out. So you walk toward the door, and you think, well, maybe I'll just make them wait. But you realize how wake the baby up if you don't take. So you go toward the leash, and it just makes you even more anxious to see it. And it's dirty. And it's chewed up, and it's gross, and you see stains on it. And you think about what those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you. And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar. And as you go out the door and he lunges outside, he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash, entering your body, through the pores of your skin and you feel like it's just running up your arm through your bloodstream. And you keep thinking oh my god, what if I get sick from this What if What if there's some germs in this or bacteria, but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and bring him back inside the house. Take the leash off. And the urge to wash is so powerful, so strong, you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these terms off from the leash. But you don't do that. You know, to make yourself not do the ritual. And then you go back in then just keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense of feeling sick, is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash. At night you go to sleep, still anxious, still upset about what happened. Wake up in the morning. And then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick, you can feel your body being sick, you rush to the bathroom and vomit You can feel the fever and the time your body is just not not right. You're sick. And you know, it's because you handled that lesion didn't wash, you didn't do the washing you needed to do. And now you're sick and the baby will probably get sick. And if only you had done the washing, okay? What's your level now?",id,,,0
100_19,P,Like 80,id,,,0
100_20,T,"Okay. Okay, you take it back and you do it again. Okay. Good job.",id,,,0
100_21,P,"Okay, so, I'm home. The dog starts barking",id,,,0
101_0,T,So I understand that you've come in because you're having a little difficulty in your relationship about that.,irq,,,1
101_1,P,"So, basically, it's been getting a little bit worse since we got married. We got married about a year and a half ago. And, you know, the the woman that I married, I thought we were both kind of independent people. And I thought that we would kind of go our separate ways or thing like we used to college, but it's kind of gotten to the point now where it's like, I just want my own personal space and I I don't want to be left alone sometimes.",id,,,0
101_2,T,"Alright, so you're looking for independence in your relationship. Now, how long have you been together? About a year?",irq,,,1
101_3,P,"total four or five years, married for a year and a half.",id,,,0
101_4,T,"And when Franklin Did you notice that? What you kind of think it was the problem like the independence, lack of independence? ",irq,,,1
101_5,P,"I guess kind of once we got married after that, it seemed like, you know, we were spending all of our time together, which, you know, at first was great because we're newlyweds, you know, we love spending time together and everything, but I guess probably about, you know, six months to a year after we first got married, it's kind of, you know, progressed to the point where, you know, now it's just kind of becoming like a burden that whatever I do, she's always there with me. We're always spending every waking moment together and sometimes it's just nice to have My own personal space is freedom, you know.",id,,,0
101_6,T,"So you're looking for that freedom. Sarah, this kind of resonate with you?",ynq,,,4
101_7,T,Can you can you tell him that?,ynq,,,4
101_8,T,"So Frank, what's it like to hear that?",irq,,,1
101_9,P,"It kind of Reminds me of how it used to be, you know, like, she said, we've been dating for four or five years and, you know, back then it It wasn't a problem, you know, she could go out and do her own thing I could go out and do my own thing to not have to worry about each other but now that we're spending every moment together, you know, it's just I'm always worried about her she's always worried about me and you know, when when I do get the chance to go you know, hang out with some friends or something like that. It always feels like, you know, I've pressure on me because I should be with her. She shouldn't be there with me, you know, and I feel like I'm doing the wrong thing by trying to be independent try to go do things by myself. I feel guilty. I do.",id,,,0
101_10,T,"So, Sarah, Do you sense that and, frankly, feels guilty about that?",ynq,,,4
101_11,T,You feel rejected.,id,,,0
101_12,P,"this a little bit after. So, like I said, probably the first six months to a year it was it was really good. But then, you know, reselling is kind of a burden. You know, just always spending time together and trying to make amends and try not to get into fights because we're always spending so much time together.",id,,,0
101_13,T,"So you mentioned that the six months to a year has been the same for you like was the beginning of the marriage, something different to what you have that",irq,,,1
101_14,T,So for you a couple months after that initial phase. So around the same time you started experiencing this difficulty in the marriage,id,,,0
101_15,T,"Okay, are you okay with some space?",ynq,,,4
101_16,P,You don't seem real certain.,id,,,0
101_17,T,"So maybe this, this idea of space isn't really something you feel will work for you.",irq,,,1
101_18,T,Do want to try to address Frank's concerns about the space?,ynq,,,4
101_19,T,You seem apprehensive about it.,id,,,0
101_20,T,"So maybe just experiment with it, try it for one night and see what happens. So, in the year and a half, you've been married, Is there ever been a night when you've gone out by yourself?",ynq,,,4
101_21,P,"Yeah, it's been a couple, especially earlier on, which is nice, you know, just, you know, getting to see old friends and you know, our old college friends, like, of course, we attended, you know, events together and like seeing old friends and everything like that, but there's been, there's been a few times, you know, not, not more than I can count on both my hands, but there's been a few times where I've, you know, gone out and just had, like, you know, a guy's night or something.",id,,,0
101_22,T,"Okay, and what would happened, like in terms of like between you, so,",irq,,,1
101_23,P,"just getting out of the house is basically the hardest part. You know, just finding a way to ensure That, you know, it'll be okay. I'm going to be back home later on in the night that she doesn't need to worry about me, you know, if I have any trouble or anything pops up that I need her help, I'll let her know. And, you know, just knowing that I love her and telling her that I love her and making sure that she knows that I'll be back. But you know, sometimes it's hard because she just gets upset when I tell her that I'm leaving and she doesn't want me to go and she would rather me stay or even take her with me. And you know, I don't want to be the only guy that shows up with my wife. You know, everybody else left their wives at home also. So I don't want to be the odd man out",id,,,0
101_24,T,"all right, so this is really an experiment that's already been tried.",irq,,,1
101_25,P,"tried twice. Yeah,",id,,,0
101_26,T,"yeah. Just Just a few times. Is there any reason to believe that if you try it next week, it'll be different?",irq,,,1
101_27,P,That's not good.,id,,,0
101_28,T,Don't you don't think so.,irq,,,1
101_29,P,"Well yeah. mean, we've been doing it, you know, the past couple months, but it seems like every time we do is you know the same result it's her getting worried about me and you know me trying to find a way to assure her that it's gonna be okay and you know that we're so married we're still in love, you know everything like that, but, you know, it's just, I really want my space and it seems like sometimes I just can't get out of her crib.",id,,,0
101_30,T,"Sir, what do you think about that?",irq,,,1
101_31,T,"All right. So in terms of the going out, although going out with your friends wouldn't have to be on the weekend that something could happen during the week.",id,,,0
101_32,P,"Yeah, absolutely. You know, a lot of my friends normally go out during the week because you know, they have their families and everything to take care of on the weekend. So, yeah, I could definitely go out tonight during the week.",id,,,0
101_33,T,"Okay, so you could agree. The both of you could agree to that as kind of terms of this behavioral experiment or weekends, you'll spend those weekends together.",id,,,0
101_34,P,I think we could try that.,ack,,,6
101_35,T,"Because that was a concern you specifically brought up. How about Sarah, how about the times during the week? How do you feel about those?",irq,,,1
101_36,T,You feel like you'd respond better to that? Would that be a better experience?,ynq,,,4
101_37,T,Something that you think that you could try next week.,id,,,0
101_38,T,"So, let's talk about when because you've gone out before and you said it was just getting out. Getting out the house that was the, the real challenge right? So walk me through. This really goes through both of you. What we through what happens when you're when you're getting ready to leave when you're planning to head out?",irq,,,1
101_39,P,"So you know, usually I'll go get dressed I'll let her know where I'm going you know, give her my cell phone number you know somebody else's phone number in case my phone is off. Just basically tell her what we're going to do you know whether we're going out to to a pole or you know, going to watch some sporting event or something like that. No, I would tell her what we're doing, you know, just so she knows and knows where she can find me. But then after that, it seems like as soon as I assure her of what we're doing, and when it's happening, when I'll be home, everything like that, it just seems like all the progress I made towards the front door kind of gets pulled back a little bit because like, she doesn't want me to leave, you know, I can see in her eyes that she's not very happy about me leaving her. And that kind of makes me feel guilty, you know, because I don't want to leave her alone. I want her to be more independent. I kind of want her to, you know, if I'm going out, I would like her to go out as well. You know, she says tons of friends. You know, we both have friends. We both have our social circles. And she's kind of it's frustrating when I can't go do my thing, because she's always got to be with me.",id,,,0
101_40,T,"So ultimately, after all that you you do go, but you feel feel guilty. And do you have a good time?",ynq,,,4
101_41,P,"Most of the time, right? Do you know, sometimes I just can't get over the fact that you know, my wife at home who's upset at me, and that makes me upset. You know, it's just a matter of finding the balance between, you know, my independence and her, you know, doing her own thing because I would like her to do that as well.",id,,,0
101_42,T,So sometimes you have a good time sometimes you don't. You're worried about Sarah being home. How about when you come home?,ynq,,,4
101_43,P,"When I come home, usually things go back to normal. I mean, we've definitely had our exchange of words after a few times me coming back. But most of the time it goes back to normal, which you know, it's fine. We're very loving, affectionate couple. So that's awesome. But you know, most the time it's just overbearing.",id,,,0
101_44,T,"Is that how you see it Sarah, the way Frank described it?",ynq,,,4
101_45,T,so how about one is out? Like so after after he's left? What do you What are you thinking that? Like?,irq,,,1
101_46,T,You're anxious something bad's gonna happen.,id,,,0
101_47,T,"Do you think that there's been any reason for that thinking, like, do you think there's any basis for thinking something bad's gonna happen? ",ynq,,,4
101_48,P,"Absolutely not. No, no, I love Sarah you know, the five years that we've worked together been great, you know, it's it's just where we are now as opposed to where we first were, and when we first got married, it's it's changed and you know, I would just like some independence just like to be on my own sometimes. And I guess I don't always relay that well to her and she doesn't understand why I want my space. I want to go hang out with my friends, but I've been trying to explain to her that, you know, it's, it's a two way street. It's not just all one way and so we have to work on these issues. And you know, that's why we came to you.",yna,,,5
101_49,T,"Alright, so you're really frustrated by not being able to go out, go out. But you're anxious about when he goes out. So we talked about the possibility of like an experiment or you go out sounds like we might run to the same difficulties you experienced before. What can we change to increase the chances of that experiment working?",irq,,,1
101_50,T,"So, so if you called when he was at Piedmont The answer is that's something that's normally possible.",id,,,0
101_51,P,"Yeah. Yeah. Most of the time, I'm very good at responding to, you know, making sure that she knows I'm okay. Making sure that she's okay.",id,,,0
101_52,T,"So that's a compromise, you'd be willing to make. Absolutely something like that. ",ynq,,,4
101_53,P,Yeah.,yna,,,5
101_54,T,"You need any other reassurances from Frank, Sarah?",irq,,,1
101_55,T,Do you have a plan to call Frank? Like when he's out? Or is it something that you would do if you just felt the need to or,irq,,,1
101_56,T,Were you calling for some specific reason?,irq,,,1
101_57,T,"Why don't you start reinsurance? Everything's going right. Okay, so that seems reasonable to you. Right? I mean, I, I guess",irq,,,1
101_58,P,"but at the same time, like when I'm out doing my own thing, you know, I kind of want that privacy in that, you know, just being in the moment you know, because I know when I get back home, from back with you and I'm, nothing's changed because I've always been with you like we're still married. But when I'm out with my friends, and you know, I'm getting a couple phone calls during you know, the night over the course of the night and it's having to deal with my wife and having to make sure that she knows I'm okay and everything like that it it gets a little frustrating. It's a little, I mean, frustrating",id,,,0
101_59,T,"Would that be a good compromise? It was a text or two. I guess. That's better than a phone call, right? Yeah. So not ideal, but you can see how it might decrease your anxiety a bit. Right? And maybe work toward a little bit more freedom. So that's how I can experiment you both combined to try.",ynq,,,4
101_60,P,"Okay, so we could try and try it out.",id,,,0
101_61,T,"Alright. So it's not a perfect plan. But it's one that you know, I would hope that we could be successful with if you could, though, you're going through it, maybe track what happens, right, from your own perspective, like what you were thinking, the fact left, what you were thinking when you left, how it went, how that separation kind of was conducted. And what happened. Same thing when, while you're out how many times you texted her If you called and then what happened when he got back? Right? That's just kind of, and you can you can keep a record of those things just independently. You know, you write it down Come your experience and you write down your experience. And we'll come back next time. No matter what happens with it, we'll compare and kind of see what see what happened and how we could make adjustments to to make it work even better.",id,,,0
102_0,T,"Now, one thing I thought we might do today is to get an example of one of these situations in which you get really anxious. And try to see if we can understand more about how you think and how you feel when you're in the middle of one of those situations. So can you think of an example of something that's happened recently? ",irq,,,1
102_1,P,"My daughter has been, she's actually been sick. And so she had a fever yesterday and they started her on an antibiotic and I had to go pick it up from the drugstore, and that's like, I don't usually go there. It's hard to get there. Like it's not right in the neighborhood. So any expressways or bridges to get there, not expressways, but It's busy, it's busier and attracting a mall. So you know, there are six lanes four lanes. Yeah. So it just, it's not someplace I usually would go. And if I was going to go, usually I would either have her go with me or my husband go with me, but she was sick and he was at work. And",id,,,0
102_2,T,"so to try to understand what goes through your mind that's trying to take you back. And now you know that the prescriptions there and your daughter's sick and I guess you don't want to ask her to drive over there. I sorted Yeah, probably not the wisest idea. So you're thinking about doing the drive and what's going through your mind? What are the thoughts that are turning inside?",irq,,,1
102_3,P,"I'm just, you know, I'm sort of thinking about going there. And I'm already starting to think well, you know, what, what if you know what if, what if I'm driving and somebody crashes into me What if I'm driving and I can't do it? You know, what if I just have to stop because I can't do it anymore and, you know, it was raining and I'm sort of like, I've got this picture of myself like out in the middle of the road and you know, what's the picture look like? You're out in the middle of the road and stranded and it's dark and my you know, you know, my shoes are gone. I'm just like, it's like I it would be a million miles to get back home. pretty miserable.",id,,,0
102_4,T,Yeah. Yeah. Pretty scary.,ack,,,6
102_5,P,"Oh, terrifying. Yeah. And I just it's so hard to get there.",id,,-2,0
102_6,T,And Kate as you as you put yourself back into that situation and have those thoughts going through your mind. What kinds of feelings go along with it?,irq,,,1
102_7,P,"My feelings I mean it things are inside like ago anxiety, physical things are going on. Well fear and anxiety and I just feel really shaky and I feel really like lightheaded and dizzy and I just don't feel like I can breathe very well and",id,,,0
102_8,T,It's just a panic attack now? He told me about having some bad ones.,id,,,0
102_9,P,but it's getting there not quite to a panic.,id,,,0
102_10,T,"Yeah, no, it's brewing.",gc,,,3
102_11,P,"Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it feels like it might. Yeah,",gc,,,3
102_12,T,"yeah. What do you think we might do to try to, to move things along toward getting a plan of attack on this, okay, is to actually sketch this out. Okay, and, and then see if we can figure out some things we might be able to start doing to give you a better handle on that you have right now. Okay. So let's put some boxes here. And one of them is going to be event these are the things that trigger your anxiety. In this case, the event was",irq,,,1
102_13,P,"the driver having to drive to the, to the pharmacy,",id,,,0
102_14,T,"drive to pharmacy. And then this next box, I'm gonna label something we call automatic thoughts. And but automatic, I mean that they occur relatively automatically, they just sort of pop into your mind, and you don't stop to check them out. Okay, and we all have these kinds of automatic thoughts. You don't have them, everybody I know has them their inner thoughts. In fact, if you think about it for a minute, we probably have a lot more thoughts. We don't speak out loud, that are part of our inner dialogue and thoughts, we actually end up speaking aloud other people. Mm hmm. And I suspect that you have lots of those thoughts and just give me some examples of them. So that's what we call an automatic.",id,,,0
102_15,P,So the like the what ifs?,irq,,,1
102_16,T,"Yeah, so let's put a couple of those down in this box. Okay, in the automatic slot box, and they are what if",id,,,0
102_17,P,someone runs into me.,id,,,0
102_18,T,Yeah. What if What else?,irq,,,1
102_19,P,What if I get stranded?,gc,,,3
102_20,T,get stranded.,gc,,,3
102_21,P,I can't do it.,yna,,,5
102_22,T,I can't do it. And then there was this image about the rainstorm and you don't have any shoes on. Yeah. so forth. What should we put down for that?,irq,,,1
102_23,P,I think what if I would if I can't get back home? I can't get back on.,id,,,0
102_24,T,sort of lost. Yeah.,ack,,,6
102_25,P,Yeah. What if I end up on this road forever?,irq,,,1
102_26,T,"Mm hmm. And then we're going to put another box there's a sort of a chain of events here. The event can make you think in ways that stir up feelings of anxiety. And so if you're thinking like this, it makes sense that you'd be feeling pretty nervous inside and you might have some of these physical reactions. Mm hmm. So let's put those in here. This is the emotion sparks They are much shaky. You said? Yeah. Quite a fear. Yeah. If we're going to write that fear on a zero to 100, scale and zeros, none at all and 100 is the maximum anyone could ever get. Where would you be at this point?",ack,,,6
102_27,P,"Oh, I'd say about an AD",id,,,0
102_28,T,"AD pretty high. Yeah. It's gotten higher though, I suspect. Oh, yeah. This point is in 18. Okay. And then you had some other feelings inside?",id,,,0
102_29,P,"Well, I yeah. I sort of felt like I might fall over. I, my heart was pounding and I didn't feel like I can",id,,-2,0
102_30,T,"breathe. Stomach any lobster. So yeah. So a lot going on here. Yeah. And a pretty high level of distress. Yes, right. And then we're going to complete this loop. Putting a box we're gonna call behavior. This is how you actually acted when you're in the situation. So what did you do? If you had these thoughts and you had these feelings,",id,,,0
102_31,P,I went to the pharmacy. He did do it. I had to okay.,gc,,,3
102_32,T,And what was it like for you when you were going to the pharmacy and driving there?,irq,,,1
102_33,P,"It was so bad. I just, you know, I, I think I left permanent marks on the steering wheel, because I was whole time.",id,,-1,0
102_34,T,"Okay, yeah. So in this case, she actually did go to the pharmacy. That year, maybe it isn't damage to the steering wheels. Yeah. Yeah, I hope not.",id,,,0
102_35,P,"But I really had no choice. I mean, I think usually I wouldn't go to the pharmacy. Usually. I would call my husband and say can you pick it up on your way home, get",id,,,0
102_36,T,"an escape route, if you would?  So usually you would avoid this if we looked at this as a model. For many of these situations about driving and feeling, yes, the usual behavior would be to try to get out of it or avoid it. Okay? And so if you do avoid it, then what happens?",irq,,,1
102_37,P,"Well, I feel better. You feel better. It's like such a relief.",id,,1,0
102_38,T,"Better relief, the emotions calm down now, right?",irq,,,1
102_39,P,"Well, yeah, cuz I don't have to, like,",id,,,0
102_40,T,"You don't have to worry about it. So that's what happens for a single episode of this anxiety. I'm wondering though, if we look at the the impact on you of avoiding and getting relief, overall, as far as managing driving, what do you think it does there?",id,,,0
102_41,P,"Well, I feel like I don't really have much confidence when it comes to this to be able to do",id,,-1,0
102_42,T,"it. Okay. So in a way, it decreases your confidence over time. I think so. Yeah. I think suspect that that not doing it repeatedly gives you this belief about your capacity to do these driving things. And what's that belief? Yeah,",irq,,,1
102_43,P,I don't feel like I can do I can't I can't do it.,id,,-1,0
102_44,T,"I can't do it. So it really comes back to this thought I can't do it. Yeah. And he can't do it. You don't do it. Right. So here's this, this chain of events, events, trigger thoughts. We call them automatic thoughts, and then they influence your emotions. He's feelings you have and then that influences how you handle the situation. Mm hmm. Okay. Now let's think together for a moment before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this. So let's take a look at these thoughts. Do you know anybody else that drives regularly that might think differently than you? Yeah, okay. I mean, an example.",id,,,0
102_45,P,"I mean, I think almost everybody, I think most people drive without too much. problem but like, my sister loves to drive. Yeah, I mean, she just she drives every opportunity she gets.",id,,,0
102_46,T,"So for some reason, we don't know exactly why. But the key thing here is not looking at why but to help you with actually making change in this. But you do have some differences in the way you think about driving. That might be something that we could begin to work on in our session, we might, for example, check it out, what's the chances of someone slamming into you? Okay, what's the chances of you being stranded out there on highway and even if you were stranded, is there a way you could cope with that or manage that you can get back home? So these are some things that we can begin to do. So I'm going to mark here, we could work on these thoughts, okay. And then by working on the thoughts, we might be able to help you reduce the emotions, but there are also some things that I might be able to teach you that you could use to reduce this level of distress that you have that Would be nice to be able to calm yourself down in situations. So we'll have some, try to build some skills to manage your emotions. And then on this behavior side, one thing that we might begin to work on is helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving things so that you can build your confidence back up. And again, build your skills to do it. And I can see that that causes a little bit of edginess here, what would you think? ",irq,,,1
102_47,P,"I was thinking that I hope that this doesn't like make me worse. Okay, no, like, trying to do some of these things.",id,,,0
102_48,T,"Well, I'm glad you gave me that feedback. That's an example by the way of me wanting to hear from you about the way you're responding to what I'm saying. I certainly wouldn't want to make it worse. Okay, but it cause you too much anxiety. Uh huh. And what we'll try to do is pace it adjust to the level that's right for you. Okay, so that you can make some progress and get to the place you want to be, which is to be able to drive to your new office, cross a bridge, and maybe even, you know, drive those couple hours to visit your son. Right. Yeah. So what do you think?",id,,,0
102_49,P,"Well, I think that that would if I could do those things that would be really nice. Yeah,",id,,,0
102_50,T,that could be really nice too. So that would be our goal. Yeah.,id,,,0
103_0,T,"between here and there, obviously, if it were easy, you wouldn't need me, you wouldn't have 13 therapists. If this were easy you would have been to a life you wanted a long time ago. So it's obvious that it's easy it already be done. Because it sounds like you're a person with a lot of motivation works really hard, because there are very few people who wouldn't quit before 13 therapists. So that's a very good quality. The very fact that you've gone through all these therapists is a good sign for us. Nonetheless, it is difficult. between here and there, there's going to be hell. Exactly. Right. So I figure our number one priority has to be to get you to stay alive through house so that we can get to the life you want. If that's where we're at. Now. We got to have some sort of agreement, not by writing a contract. Because I'll fire you if you try to kill yourself that because we both sort of have to face the fact that to get there you got to go through there and to go through there you got to stay alive.",id,,,0

104_13,T,"okay, but part of the problem is those look deep in like you're going to have significant scars. So my suggestion is in the future if you do it is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed. But let's talk about how how this happened. First of all, tell me you were telling me on the phone that you wanted to die? But did you? Was this a suicide attempt? Or do you think was just just a cutting we thinking about killing yourself or wanting to kill yourself or wanting to die? ",irq,,,1
104_14,P,I was thinking about killing myself? I thought you would help me and you didn't. That's what I want to talk about. I want to talk about how it is that my life is not going better and you are not helping me and you're not available to me when I need help.,id,,,0

104_16,P,I cut myself the first time I called you thinking you would help me You wouldn't help me. So then I figured what the hell I might as well just go all the way and so that's why I cut myself that deep,id,,,0

107_26,T,All right. Do you have the activity or item in mind? We could put in place as something you could reward yourself with?,irq,,,1
107_27,P,Like after the first five pounds?,irq,,,1
107_28,T,"Well, there's a few ways we could do it. We could do that. So you reach five pounds. And then you can give yourself that reward work could be for something you do every day. If that day you're successful in eating the way you want, he would you think would motivate you more?",id,,,0
107_29,P,Maybe something every day.,id,,,0
107_30,T,"Yes, you know, each and every day as you're trying to lose weight. You're aware. When that day comes to close if you had a successful night, they were a less than successful day, right? If you have a successful day, then you could engage in an activity or receiving items that we work out in advance that, you know, would motivate you.Right? ",id,,,0
107_31,P,"And that could be, you know, maybe watching like a favorite TV show. Okay, you know, because I don't watch TV at night, because I'm so busy cleaning up and everything. Maybe I could just take some time for myself, because I did something good. You know, I just watch a TV show.",id,,2,0
107_32,T,"So let's let's do that. On a day, you know, towards the evening. When you know, you have had a successful day and by what time would you know, in the evening?",irq,,,1
107_33,P,"Probably as I'm preparing dinner, if I prepare food dinner, or if I prepare fun food for my kids, but I don't eat it like chicken nuggets and french fries and stuff.",id,,,0
107_34,T,"Let's say some Okay, say so by 7pm at that point in terms of the day being successful or less than successful, you know, okay, right at 7pm, you're aware. And at that point, if you have met your call, then you have a you have a TV show that you maybe it's recorded on a TV or something you would watch, okay? And if you were not as successful you would write. So I'd be like something to keep you motivated about the day because you really want to watch that show. Right? A lot of fun.

107_35,P,"I don't know honestly, but it would probably be the way right now",id,,-2,0
107_36,T,"And this is something you could also track. Right? You could write down days that are successful days or lessons less than successful. And we could look at if there's any patterns, maybe weekends are harder, because they're easier or something where we can identify days that have maybe more triggers or we're less motivated.",id,,,0
107_37,P,"Yeah, I didn't think about that. Because right every day would be different.",id,,,0
107_38,T,"Okay, there's the potential for every day to be different with what you're exposed to, and what temptations in terms of different foods, what your schedules like maybe for busier things easier. So we can We can look at those different patterns. And we can add levels to this plan. Okay, but for now we'll go with the TV show that you'll watch sometime after seven, seven, you evaluate how you did, sometime after that. watch the show, okay? That's like a plan. ",id,,,0
107_39,P,"So that's leading up to the five pounds. Right? Right. Okay,",irq,,,1
107_40,T,"day by day, okay, this and five pound increments, okay, four times to get to your goal. 20 pounds. Okay. Sounds good. So far. So, we'll give that a shot. And we'll take a look at the pattern that emerges, support everything. I say, write everything down. Okay, probably at around seven is a good time. When you know kind of day ahead, write down kind of what happened that day and whether you've had success or not. And bring that in. I'll see you again week.

109_9,T,"Yeah. I do you think she's emotionally guarded. Um, I think she'll speak to that later in the session. You know, so it says I think there have been injuries. Some of which I'm going to guess really are related to the the race pieces that she's experienced where she has felt judged under scrutiny and it just keeps repeating herself and it's separate from competitors. Man accomplishments and so there is a guardedness and there is a sensitivity and the guardedness is her way of protecting some of her vulnerability. Okay, let's move on to",id,,,0
11_0,P,"I don't want to talk to you anymore. You're all the same. All of you. I have been wasting my time wasting my time. You're all, you're all the same. All you guys are exactly the same. You asked me to come in and just, I don't want to talk to you anymore because I come in here and I talk and I talk and I talk and talk and I don't get anything out of it. You're all the same.",yna,,,5
11_1,T,"When you say,",irq,,,1
11_2,P," You are all of you, all of you all therapy,",id,,,0
11_3,T,"Okay, I mean, I'm having a couple three reactions to what you're saying. I mean, one is that you're saying you're all the same and",irq,,,1
11_4,P,we're all the same. You're all the same. In the for you guys. Nothing is working. Right. Nothing is working.,id,com,,0
11_5,T,"I mean, I'm feeling just lumped in with everybody else right now. ",irq,,,1
11_6,P,"Well, you are because you're all the same. Of course, you're lumped in with everybody. I'm not gonna single you out. Not gonna make you you know, single you out because you're not doing anything. You don't do anything. There's all this abstract metaphysical stuff and there's no concrete. This is the way to fix it. This is the goal. There's nothing so what's the point?",yna,crq,,5
11_7,T,"I mean, it's there's something specific right now that I could say or do that that would fill, give you what you're wanting or need.",id,,,0
11_8,P,"How do I, how do you how do I go from point A to point B? How do I get better? How do I fix what's going on? I mean, that's the reason I came here. Right? I thought there was a reason I came here is to fix things. make things better.",irq,,,1
11_9,T,"So you want sort of a, like a kind of, sort of like step by step description of",ynq,,,4
11_10,P,what something I need something to grab onto something to hold something Grab onto Yeah.,yna,,,5
11_11,T,"Yeah. See, my sense is that you know, that you sort of desperately want something to grab on to, to get to give you some sense of hope. And, and I really want to be able to, you know, to give you something but but it feels like there's something about the kind of intensity of your, of your sort of demand or play right now. Which, which makes it difficult for me to really sort of respond in a way that's going to give you what you need. Or, you know, a better way of putting it is, you know, have a sense that the kind of thing that you want or needing or needing has to kind of come out of an organic process between the two of us and there's something about the sort of intensity of your desperation with Which makes it difficult for you to really be open and receptive to whatever I have to give",irq,,,1
11_12,P,"just the way I am I always come out like that I always sway I get things. So the only way I get that's the only way I know how to be. I come out one of two ways. I come out either full, full throttle, just full, full tilt, just come out and just do it that way or I don't do anything at all. So it's like I one way and it's not good enough and on the other way and it's not good enough so ",id,,,0
11_13,T,so it's like,ack,,,6
11_14,P,"damned if you do damned if I do damned if I don't. If I go one way at everybody, it you know it doesn't seem to make a difference one way or the Other and then if I'm just quiet and you know, just fall in with the crowd, it doesn't matter either. So",yna,,,5
11_15,T,"it sounds like it feels like you only have two choices, right that you can you can either approach the situation kind of on the attack, you know with with both guns blazing. It's a good way to describe",irq,,,1
11_16,P,it both guns blazing.,yna,,,5
11_17,T,"Right or or the alternative is to kind of go along and compromise yourself in some way. Right. Right. Have those two which, which feels better, which feels worse?",irq,,,1
11_18,P,"Well, the bulk guns blazing always feels better because if I go at somebody with with, you know, full force and, you know, hit them over the head, you know, and just and just go at them. Even if they turn away, it doesn't really matter. Because I've already sent my face and so when I say, but if I don't say anything, I just sit back and don't do anything, then it just gets me as angry as the full guns blazing. So it just they eats me up, but it eats me up in here and I get even angrier than if I just blurt it all out and get it all out.",id,,,0
11_19,T,"Right. Yeah, I can imagine that right that right, if you end up you know, at least if you're going in there with with both guns blazing, there's a way in which you can kind of feel okay about yourself in some way, even though you're not getting your needs met. Right. But somehow they're, you know, sort of giving in, it's like you're giving away part of yourself in some way. So, I mean, you know, it seems to me that the you know, the dilemma is that you have no good way of getting your needs met right now, right. You sort of desperately need Something right, but a middle ground. There's no middle ground. Okay. So, you know, I'm not sure exactly what that middle ground is right now. But I'm willing to work with you to, you know, to really work on discovering what that middle ground is. Does that does that seem worthwhile?",irq,,,1
11_20,P,I have to have to find a middle ground.,yna,,,5
11_21,T,"Okay, but what are you feeling right now?",irq,,,1
11_22,P,"Just it bothers me. I can't go one way or the other. It's like, try to do one thing. You can't do it and try to the other way. Can't do it. Just I'm just stuck.",id,,,0
11_23,T,There's a real kind of sadness there.,ynq,,,4
11_24,P,yes,ack,,,6
11_25,T,Look at me. The sense of what's what's going on for us? It sounds as if here. You're asking for something. Yeah.,irq,,,1
11_26,P,I need something I can't get myself.,id,,,0
11_27,T,"Yeah. Yeah, I, you know, I hear that I hear the, you know, you're sort of desperation and I hear your sadness and your pain and your hopelessness. You know, when I'll do my best to help you",gt,hp,,2

110_3,P,"Yes, I did. ",yna,,,5
110_4,T,Fabulous. Okay. So would you mind if we just spend a few minutes going through that together now?,ynq,,,4
110_5,P,"Yeah, no, that's okay. ",yna,,,5
110_6,T,"So I guess something really important that I would like to draw your attention to first of all, is this issue here of confidentiality, okay. Basically, everything that you and I talk about together in therapy is just between you and I, however, because I am a professional psychologist, the things that we discussed, I may need to share with my supervisor, okay. ",id,,,0
110_7,P,"Yeah, yeah, that's all right. Will it only be with your supervisor?",ynq,,,4
110_8,T," Yeah, that's right. Yep. Yeah. There are a few special circumstances though, where I may have to break confidentiality. That is if you tell me that you might be of harm to yourself or someone else. Okay. If you tell me that you've been involved in a serious crime, okay for us. Somebody else wishes to access the information that we talked about in the context of legal proceedings and they take it off subpeona I'm required to give that information then okay. But of course, if any of these things ever did come up, I would discuss these with you first. Okay, that'd be good. Okay. All right. All right. So something else I just would like to draw your attention to here as well. It's just our fee here at the clinic. Yes. Which as we discussed on the phone is $20.",ack,,,6
110_9,P,Yes. And that's fine. No problems.,id,,,0
110_10,T,Okay. And I understand from time to time that things can come up as well and that you might have to reschedule one of your appointment. We just asked that if you could provide us with about 24 hours notice beforehand shot so that gives us a chance to be able to set up another appointment time.,id,,,0
110_11,P,"Yeah, yeah, that's fine. No worries. ",yna,,,5
110_12,T,Okay. Did you have any other questions about anything that you read on that shape there?,ynq,,,4
110_13,P,"Um, no. it all seems fine with me. Yeah. ",yna,,,5
110_14,T,Yeah. Okay. So if you wouldn't mind just popping your signature at the bottom there. Thanks.,id,,,0
110_15,P,"I haven't, I'm feeling a little nervous. ",id,,-2,0
110_16,T,"Yeah, I can understand that it can be a bit confronting and scary The first time you come along. Yeah. So I guess, I mean, just to give you a bit of an idea about how I like to work with clients, is that I like it to be a collaborative approach so that the two of us get to work together on new problems and concerns that you're having at the moment. Okay. ",id,,,0
110_17,P,Yeah. Sounds good.,ack,,,6
110_18,T,"So the purpose of today's session, I guess, would be for me to get more of an understanding of what's happening for you lately. All right, and give us a chance to get to know each other a little bit more. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's really good. Yeah. And at the end, we can sort of have a touch base again and see how we went for today and whether we'd like to take it on from there.",id,,,0
110_19,P," Yeah, that sounds good. We'll have a better idea then. ",yna,,,5
110_20,T,"Yes, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay. So I mean, just to start off with then I guess, are there any other things that you've tried apart from coming to therapy and As some ways to help you cope with what's happening for you.",irq,,,1
110_21,P,"Umm not really like when I feel ya know, when I feel down like I just stay at home. Yeah, I don't really go anywhere. Yeah. or do anything I just yeah, just sort of withdraw. That's all I really done. ",yna,,,5
110_22,T,Yeah. We've been really keeping it to yourself and it's quite a big step for you to reach out to to someone today.,id,,,0
110_23,P,"Yeah, it is. It just got to that point where he just wanted to come in and didn't really know what to do. Yeah. ",id,,,0
110_24,T,"Okay, I guess to start off with him. Would you like to tell me a little bit more about what's been happening for you? ",ynq,,,4

112_16,T,Just want everything to go on?,ynq,,,4

112_18,T,And this is the place that you can say what needs to be said.,id,,,0
112_19,P,"Yeah. Yeah. That is part of me that almost feels angry with all the stuff I've got to do, and I don't feel like I'm getting the support that I need. And it's really difficult. I feel like I have to do it all myself.",ack,,,6

I guess he had expectations of how I would be and how we would be and how this would be and I think that he's disappointed in me. And then that doesn't help and so then I sort of feel like I have to do it to prove that I am okay and that I am kind of holding it all together. And I do love these. ",id,,,0
112_24,T,So trying to keep a mask up. Trying to seem as though it's okay.,irq,,,1

112_28,T,"so at this point, and it's six weeks, they've been a really rough. Six weeks feels to me like really rough. Having waited so long to have this child gone through the birth and understand from a GPM pump was a somewhat difficult birth if it wasn't from I thought it was. So from the very start, it hasn't been as you thought.And now you're at that point where the reality is the reality of this baby. It sounds to me that there's a struggle going on for you. But a struggle that you're feeling very much alone with",id,,,0
113_0,T,"So, Felicity, I think that we've done a lot of good work today. And I'm delighted that you didn't have a panic attack last week. That's really impressive.

113_6,T," Yeah, I can imagine so he has been really upset by that.",id,,,0

113_8,T,"Yes, I can see that really causes you more anxiety as well that this is happening and yeah, you feel criticized by your mom and perhaps torn a bit between your mom's view and David? Yeah, I do. You talk to him.",id,,,0
113_9,P,"While she doesn't, she doesn't want me to talk to him. about it because she doesn't want him to know that she doesn't like him. And then you know, he doesn't really like her as well, because she thinks he thinks that she's a snob. And so it's really hard. You know, I just feel like I'm sort of, sort of in the middle and like in between the two of them. Yeah. But",id,,-1,0
113_10,T,"so felicity. I'm very pleased that you didn't have a panic attack last week. Yeah. And and so are you. Yeah. And I'm hoping that the work that we did today, in looking at a couple more techniques of how you can manage the anxiety has been helpful to you.",id,,,0

I've told you about Dave before because she doesn't like Dave and she was having a got me for the drug. You know, cuz he takes the drugs and she was just yelling at me because she doesn't like that he takes the drugs, but the student doesn't understand that. I mean, I just want to be with you.

113_16,T,"I can see that this is very upsetting for you. felicitated is an issue that you've raised before. So I'm wondering whether we should decide that for next week, we'll start to discuss these issues that you're having with your mom so that we can work out a plan when we've got our next session. How would that be? ",irq,,,1
113_17,P,"Well, this one, this one, I mean, the argument was, when she was saying she was saying to me that I should leave him. And she was saying, you know, that I could do a lot better and that I really shouldn't be with him. And I should just leave she was saying, but you know, and then she wouldn't let me you know, because I wanted to talk to him about it, and she wouldn't let me talk to him about it. And because I really don't like each other, I just I'm really sort of stuck in the middle.",id,,,0
113_18,T,"And I can see that that's a really big issue. So I think we definitely will put this on a number one agenda for next week. Okay. And so We'll work on a theme because this is clearly very important to you. Yeah. And I think that we're going to need a good chunk of time to be able to help you to resolve some of these issues with your mom. I can't How about during the week on? In addition to the other homework you have, you have to think about what the issues are that you would like to raise with me next week about this.",irq,,,1

114_0,T,Did you know you were telling me a few minutes ago about some stuff that's been going on for you recently? That seems to have been quite upsetting for you. I'm wondering if you can give me a bit more information.,irq,,,1
114_1,P,"Yeah, look, it hasn't been a good week for me this week and I'm telling you about the problems my boyfriend and we broke up and I'm not coping with i. I'm hurt. Just you don't understand why this is happening one more time. Just one more time. And it's just pushed me over the edge. And it just happens to me all the time.",id,,-1,0
114_2,T,Do you think it'll get any better?,irq,,,1
114_3,P,"it won't get better and you don't understand. It happens to me all the time. Meaning given to me now, serving in the wrong with me. I feel like there's something really wrong with me. People don't just reject me all the time. I don't know why. ",id,,,0
114_4,T,"So I mean, I can say that you're really upset about this stuff. That's your boyfriend journey. just keeps you just like always happy.",id,,,0
114_5,P,"Now he doesn't want to talk to me and I feel like if I was, if I was a better person, then this wouldn't happen. I just feel like, isn't because of me. Nobody understands and I just can't do this. I can't do this again.",id,,,0
114_6,T,"I mean, I Has there been other stuff that's been going on for you during the week?",irq,,,1
114_7,P,He does break up with me just the other day. I cant' sleep and I can't eat And he just keeps going and he just won't answer the phone and why you need me and you just don't,id,,-1,0
114_8,T,"want to know I know that when you break up with someone, it's really upsetting. Over time, this sort of stuff should get better, I think.",id,,,0
114_9,P,how long?,irq,,,1
114_10,T,"Well, it just takes a bit of time.",id,,,0
114_11,P,I can't make it through the time he may help me get through the time it gets. This time. It just feels like it's never gonna end. When is that?,irq,,,1
114_12,T,"It certainly sounds really tough. I think it's important that we talk about other stuff also, though, that went on during the week other than the breakup.",id,,,0
114_13,P,"Just Yeah,",ack,,,6
114_14,T,I can see that's really upsetting.,id,,,0
114_15,P,Because He rejected me because I'm not good enough. Maybe there's something inside me that's been broken or something. And I won't even talk to me now. I need someone that say that it's gonna be okay. And it's okay.,id,,-1,0
114_16,T,Sure it will be fine in the long term. Even though it's tough right now.,ack,,,6
115_0,T,"Okay, Felicity, before we start to talk about what you've come here to see me for today, I just wanted to raise an issue with you. I think we both realized when you walked in here that we've seen each other before. ",id,,,0
115_1,P,"Yeah, I'm Jake's mom. I've seen you at kindy. ",ack,,,6
115_2,T,"That's right. That's right. We do run into each other, a fair bit at the kindergarten. So I suppose what that brings up for me is that I'm a psychologist, and there is certain boundaries that I have to uphold with my clients. And I think that we need to talk about what we're going to do about this, that we we do see each other quite often and how we're going to manage that in terms of, you know, keeping those appropriate boundaries within therapy and outside the therapy room.",id,,,0
115_3,P,Okay. Yeah.,ack,,,6
115_4,T," So how I say this, we have a few different options. The first one is that we could decide not to engage in therapy together. Given that, you know, there could be some issues when we see each other outside of therapy. Okay, how would that option sit for you? ",irq,,,1
115_5,P,"Well, um, I guess, part of the problem for me is that I really, I feel that I really need to talk to someone about what's going on for me and I don't really, there's no one else in town I can talk to okay. ",id,,,0
115_6,T,"Yeah, psycho psychology services are quite limited in this area. Yeah. Okay. So you really feel that you need the help and this is the only option that you've got. So given that that's the case. How do you think we could manage this one we do run into each other outside of the therapy rooms so that we don't cross over you know, the boundaries of therapists and clients. So if I see you at the kindergarten shall we acknowledge each other and you know, keep walking or how would you like to manage it? ",irq,,,1
115_7,P,"No, I mean, I think I think it's good if you know if we can, like say hi and stuff, but I mean, I probably Probably wouldn't want to talk to you at kindy about what we do here in case other people hear it.",id,,,0
115_8,T,"Sure, sure. And I'm really glad that you brought that point up, because I think that, given that we will run into each other quite a bit at the kindergarten, it's fine for us to acknowledge each other, but we do need to keep the therapeutic issues that we talk here in therapy for therapy. Yeah, yeah. I'm glad that you think that it that would not be appropriate. ",id,,,0
115_9,P,"Yeah. Yeah.  And I mean, you wouldn't, you wouldn't tell anybody other moms, would you?",irq,,,1

Yeah. How is it today?",id,,,0
119_5,P,"It's been it's been up and down. I think today, it's probably a seven again. But you know, I've been back down to a nine lately. I guess maybe I feel a little better because I'm coming here. And I know, we'll get to talk about it a little bit. But I guess you know, last time we were talking about me trying to get a job and live full time job. And I think I just realized last week that it's really hard for me to work full time right now. You know, I'm doing the part time thing with the work program, and they want us to do volunteer work in the afternoon, if we haven't found a full time job by a certain week. And I just, you know, just thinking about it, and I just don't think I can do that. I just don't think I can work for eight hours every day. It's just too much.",id,,-2,0
119_6,T,"So you're having some concerns about full time work and that level of energy, you'd have to exert that commitment. Alright, so we'll be okay today, if we kind of structured, what we're going to do sure for for this session. So, if it's okay with you, I'd like to talk about that. Okay. All right and and get some more details about kind of what's going on this week and your feelings surrounding that. And we touched on this a little bit in the last session. But I'd like to talk about kind of your core beliefs, your central beliefs that might be contributing some of these feelings of depression. Yeah. And then, for the last part, we'll work on like we did before, interventions to try to help you with with what's going on at work and with your depressed mood.

119_8,T,"Okay. So, tell me a little bit more about what's going on with the work.",irq,,,1
119_9,P,"Well, I mean, I don't really know why it is. I know I'm always tired because I just I have so much trouble sleeping, as I told you before. It's just It doesn't matter how tired I am, I can't sleep, but it's just I go, I go in the morning, you know, eight to noon, but then in the afternoon, it's just like, it's so hard to keep going on. It's just such a long amount of time. And I just feel like, I don't know if I can really do it. And especially in the winter, you know, if you work eight hours, by the time you get out of work, it's dark out and it just makes my depression so much worse.",id,,-2,0
119_10,T,"So, the latter part of the day is more of a struggle for you.",irq,,,1
119_11,P,"
 Yeah, a lot of hard work day.",id,,-1,0
119_12,T,So getting up in the morning and getting to work on time. You do okay with that.,irq,,,1
119_13,P,"It's hard. It's hard, but I feel like I'm better at that. I'm better at it. I'm already up anyway. So, you know, I know I gotta get up. I gotta do what I have to do.",id,,-1,0
119_14,T,"So the work program you're in now, you work in the morning?",ynq,,,4
119_15,P,Yeah.,yna,,,5
119_16,T,What hours are you there?,irq,,,1
119_17,P,Eight to noon.,id,,,0
119_18,T,And there's some work you have to do in the afternoon.,irq,,,1
119_19,P,"Well, yeah, since I've been there for what is it eight weeks. And I haven't found a job yet. They want us to volunteer in the afternoon and they find us our own place of volunteer. So that's good. I don't have to find that myself. But I guess they want to get you used to doing something for eight hours a day and maybe you have something to put on your resume. And guess what? have like a big gap in your resume that doesn't look good either. So haven't been able to say a work tear even though I didn't make money. But just thinking about it, it's so exhausting. And you know, I get out of the work program and I think if I did go to, I can barely make it home. It's just so all I want to do is go home.",id,,-1,0
119_20,T,Thinking about it's exhausting. Can you tell me what type of thoughts you're having?,id,,,0
119_21,P,"I just don't think I can do it. Like, I just don't think I'm the kind of person that can work eight hours a day. And it just makes me feel like what's the point like, I'm going to work eight hours a day.",id,,-1,0
119_22,T,I don't think I can just there's just too many hours.,id,,,0
119_23,P,Yeah.,yna,,,5
12_0,T,"So, can you think of another case you're working on another family different than the one that we've initially talked about? Where you've made a decision that seemed like was fairly clear caught like one you would have made before and yet you're, you're thinking about it replaying it?",irq,,,1
12_1,P,"Yeah, I have this case. You know recently where it's a single dad, the mom passed away and I go in and check on him and his son, you You know, things are going well, but, you know, I think the dad has a hard time so it's not like it was before when the mom was there. Not that I wasn't there before that but you can just tell that like, things are a little different. But you know, obviously, my decision is that things are going well for the kid, you know, they're gonna he's gonna stay there. Dad is stable, but I just worried like, is the dad under too much stress? Is he really taking care of the kid as good as you know, what if he's just cleaning up the house and doing the right things on there while I'm not there? You know, does he have the energy to take care of his kid? Or is everything really the way I it appears? Or is there more going on? I just don't know.",id,,-2,0
12_2,T,Right. So you're handling it to the best of your ability. But there's still these these thoughts that are coming out. Kind of encouraging you to second guess your judgment?,ack,,,6
12_3,P,"Yeah. And it's like, I can't let it go. Like, I saw him like two weeks ago. And I still wonder if I have other cases like that. It's like, they're all running through my head. And I have these thoughts like, Did I do the right thing? Can I do the right thing?",id,,-2,0
12_4,T,"Maybe what if, what if the worst happens?",irq,,,1
12_5,P,"And I didn't see it. Like, what if something terrible happens? And I should have known better.",id,,-2,0
12_6,T,"So it speaks back to your competency as a professional again. So that's, that seems to be court this. I think Here are several things you talk about seem to connect back to. Are you capable to be in this field? And should you be trusted?",id,,,0
12_7,P,"Yeah, definitely.",yna,,,5
12_8,T,"So coming back to thinking there are errors and thinking that all people make. And when these errors become repetitive and you can kind of see them applied in more than one areas of his life. We refer to that as a cognitive distortion. Okay? It's not bad or good. It's just how people think. It's just patterns that people fall into. And there are several different cognitive distortions, there's several patterns that we kind of see. come up often in this work, right as a counselor, wondering, in the situation where you're thinking, the worst possible outcome is unbearable, or likely or both. If you may be really focusing and emphasizing on that, to the exclusion of other evidence that suggests you've made a good decision. I see you're really focused on the negative outcome, the worst possible and maybe even unlikely outcome. And maybe not weighing all the evidence with the same weight, like you're putting more weight on the negative pay, that kind of makes sense.",id,,,0
12_9,P,"Yeah. I mean, I think that that's probably true. Because before I felt fine, and now I just feel like everything's falling apart and not that much has changed. And so it kind of makes me think that that's probably what's going on, but I don't know how to change that.",id,,,0
